{"1726": ["Imaginative illustration of an epic story. It combines the modern background society, e.g. terrorism, with the unconventional high-tech fantasy. Our leading actor Robert Downey Jr. deeply embodies the soul of the Iron Man in himself. We common people never lived this way :P", "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nMarking the beginning of the latest Marvel franchise, _The Avengers_, is Jon Favreau's _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Super Hero movies, I don't love them to the same extent that I do the slasher or psychological thriller genres, but they do hold a small place in my heart all to themselves. I'm pretty pumped for this whole \"Avengers\" thing to come to fruition, 'cause honestly it's all been great so far, starting with Iron Man, whom Robert Downey Jr. (_Natural Born Killers, Gothika, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Sherlock Holmes, Due Date_) portrays, and incredibly so.\r\n\r\nIt's important to set yourself a starting point. More specifically, what I mean is, a reason. Batman's parents were murdered, and his home was destroyedby crime; The Punisher's whole family was murdered in front of him and he big-time snapped; characters like the X-Men and the Fantastic 4 are defending themselves and end up having a penchant for world-saving. Those are all fine, and so long as you have one, I'm happy. But I really kind of like Tony Stark's reason for becoming Iron Man... He's a dick. That's why. He's a dick that supplies the world with the most lethal weapons in existence, and they take lives left, right and centre. Then, he's put through the world where they get used, and finally is told by the person who helped him escape that world, not to waste his life. He believes he is still alive for a reason, he decides that reason is to become a dick that is intent on privatising world peace. Which I think makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nThat may have come across as sarcasm, but I was deadly serious. Tony Stark becomes Iron man, and that's why. It works fantastically. We then get to see all the incarnations of his suit, how difficult it was to make, what it runs on, the technology, everything. And I'm a huge fan of back story, which Iron Man delivers.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of the antithesis of DC's _Batman Begins_. Though they're both young adults that come from money with no family, a British butler (although Iron man's butler Jarvis was transformed into AI for the film [he was an actual person in the comics]), they have a board of directors take care of their family's billionaire business until they're ready to eventually take the reins, they both become \"____ Man\" and go about saving the innocent, not through superpowers but technology. I'm sure I could go on. But they're also incredibly different. Where Batman is a total bad ass, the gothic unknown defender of the night that uses fear as a weapon to protect his home town, and yet refuses to kill; Iron Man is a bright, shiny, loud attention grabber, who goes all international to fight crime, he wants the world to know he's Iron Man and his enemies are totally lame, so no wonder he has no qualms about killing! Batman's secret identity, Bruce Wayne, is an angsty tosser, that tries way to hard. But Tony Stark, is a witty, brilliant inventor, who has basically harnessed all of Batman's training, strength, weapons, vehicles and flight, improved them, and put them in to a single suit. So though I personally prefer Batman as a hero, I prefer Tony Stark as a character.\r\n\r\nThe interaction between Stark and Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (_Se7en, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Royal Tenenbaums, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_) was incredible. It just goes to show what good casting can achieve, even in an action flick, the dialogue is hilarious and clever. Is it possible for a Super Hero movie to be a bad Super Hero film but a great film? I guess it is.\r\n\r\nThe antagonists are lacking to say the least, and their dispatching leaves even more to be desired. Which is normally not too huge when you get the rest so perfect, unfortunately, it's a comic book film, about Super Heroes, and Super Villains. They fight one another over and over, in fact that's pretty much what the comics are about in their entirety, so it's quite a major short coming. That being said, it's really the only one that _Iron Man_ has. In a way though, they're a similar comparison to the latest Batman films again; Iron Monger and Whiplash are flashy, but disappointing, where The Joker, Two-Face, Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul are top notch as bad guys. Whereas Ironman's Obadiah Stane and Ivan Vanko were great characters, but Batman's The Joker is only seen in his villain persona, and Harvey Dent, Jonathan Crane and Henri Ducard are nothing more than vessels for their alter-egos.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, the film is just plain good, and you don't need to be a fan of Iron Man, Super Heroes or comics in general to enjoy _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\n82%\r\n\r\n-Gimly", "Iron Man did a lot more than just launch the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was the first comic book movie in a long time to integrate the fantastical nature of superheroes and supervillains into a real world setting with consequences. It also showed how great of a filmmaker Jon Favreau is and rebooted the career of Robert Downey Jr.\r\n\r\nFor all this, Iron Man is a fantastic movie, still one of the best MCU films. It's so much fun to watch. Yet it displays a lot of intelligence, exploring the internal dilemma of a man profiteering off war when faced with the harsh reality that he is part of a system that corrupts absolutely."], "1724": ["**A long form review originally posted in 2011:**\r\n\r\nDubbed as a \u201cre-quel\u201d, _The Incredible Hulk_ was first released in 2008, and now, I\u2019m here to review it in the line of Marvel films I\u2019m getting through a the moment. \r\n\r\nI always like to think of films individually, but with the Marvel Cinematic Universe getting so big, that can be rather difficult to do. So though I may comment on films in relation to their sequels, remakes, prequels, spin-offs, parodies and the like, know that my final score out of ten is always based purely on the films merits, or lack thereof. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty crazy seeing Edward Norton (_American History X, Fight Club, Red Dragon, Kingdom of Heaven, Pride and Glory, Stone_) as a very scrawny Bruce Banner, considering that he turns into the giant, muscular Hulk. But to me it totally worked. As an interesting side-note, Norton co-wrote the script, which may or may not have contributed to his being ousted as Banner for any future films after the movie was released. Not because the script is particularly awful or anything, but because as a general rule production doesn\u2019t like actors getting all up in \"dey grillz\" half way through. Although it\u2019s not like Norton\u2019s never done this sort of thing before.\r\n\r\nUnder-appreciated Tim Roth (_Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Planet of the Apes, Lie to Me, Rob Roy_) is also excellent (as far as I\u2019m concerned) playing the role of Abomination/Emil Blonsky. Interesting side-note, no, he\u2019s not related to Eli Roth, who\u2019s also a friend and actor of Quentin Tarantino and his films.\r\n\r\nUltimately, _The Incredible Hulk_ is a fine film, but it just can\u2019t stand up to the superior writing and character building of Thor, Iron Man or Iron Man 2. Liv Tyler (_The Strangers, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Armageddon_) is rather a non-event as supposed love interest Betty Ross. And William Hurt (_Robin Hood, A History of Violence, The Village, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Dark City_) as semi-antagonist General Thunderbolt Ross, is nothing but annoying (although it is pretty cool to see just how much they got him looking like the comic book character he is based on.\r\n\r\nYou would\u2019ve thought that having a modern day Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story to run with, backing from the success of the franchise you\u2019ve got supporting you, that it would be easy to write strong characters, unfortunately, it\u2019s not the case. And while the action sequences are cool, and the fighting is possibly some of the best that Marvel\u2019s come up with, it\u2019s not enough to bring this film up to the standards of the other 3. The film lacks the flair I\u2019m sure everyone would be expecting, and while it\u2019s a perfectly good monster-movie movie, perhaps a completely separate Super Hero origin story would have been better than the overly-CGI-ridden quasi-sequel to 2003\u2019s _The Hulk_ that we ended up with.\r\n\r\n66%\r\n\r\n_-Gimly_", "It's an improvement on the Ang Lee film only in the sense that the smashy smashy bits are more entertaining than the previous film's thinky thinky bits. But the fact that the entire film is just one long extended fight scene is disappointing to us who enjoy the darker, more emotional beats of the Hulk's story. I enjoy this movie quite a bit as a well put together piece of fluff entertainment, but I hold no delusions that even Marvel Studios couldn't get the definitive version of Hulk on screen."], "10138": ["It was understood that the theaters would be sold out but when the three of us came there we just couldn't accept NO for an answer. So we were finally able to buy tickets BUT we were seated separately. It was fine though. The movie kept me entertained.

There might be weird critics with this movie but for me, I liked it. The action scenes were just right. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together. But all in all I liked the movie. Seeing old characters from the first movie and new characters. I can't wait for a 3rd Iron Man movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B+.", "Yet another ridiculously high rated Marvel movie, we get it Marvel fanboys you just love it when a new Marvel movie comes out, so much that you forget any flaws in it and give it a 10 or a 9 anyways.\r\n\r\nBut come on seriously? Wouldn't you rather they spent a little time at actually writing a somewhat decent script and making it a bit more entertaining than to praise EVERYTHING they do to the skies just because you want a new chapter in the Marvel universe?\r\n\r\nCause this is NOT a good movie, 35 minutes of decent at best action and 85 minutes of nonsensical blabber.\r\n\r\nMickey Rourke was the only highlight in this movie, the scene at the racetrack with him was really cool but then he just became a wasted opportunity just like the rest of the movie.\r\n\r\nA really boring turd of a film.", "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nI find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.\r\n\r\nWhen films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are \"Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it.\" Very classy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.\r\n\r\nThe Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; \"Congratulations sir, you have created a new element\", is a little flawed.\r\n\r\nThough if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.\r\n\r\n63%\r\n\r\n-Gimly", "Honestly, it took me three tries to get through this movie once.

Instead, we get Tessa Thompson's badass Valkyrie, who can hold her own in a fight and isn't just there just as a love interest for Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Jeff Goldblum is hilarious as Grandmaster, who runs the gladiator fights on the planet Sakaar. But the real pleasure of the movie is watching the love-hate brother relationship between Thor and his adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The relationship between the two men was the only redeeming feature of TDW, and it's great to see it expanded in this movie. Also great is seeing Thor buddy up with Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fate of The Warriors Three. They deserved better than that. But otherwise, it's a great comic book movie.", "From minute one, Thor Ragnarok bursts onto the screen with a new found energy, style, Jeff Goldblum, beautiful use of colours and shot compositions, an amazing 80s inspired music score, and comedy that's actually funny. Somehow, Thor Ragnarok is both the darkest film in the entire MCU given that it deals with the destruction of an entire world, and the most lighthearted.\r\n\r\nThor Ragnarok is very much a Taika Waititi film that uses Marvel lore and characters.

I honestly felt like Red Skull could have had a film all to himself, and actually kind of suffered for making him as intriguing as he was.\r\n\r\nChris Evans was an interesting choice as the titular role of Captain America, given that he's already played American sweetheart Marvel Super Hero \"The Human Torch\" in _Fantastic 4_ and _Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer_. He didn't Oh-My-Gosh blow me away type-thing or what have you, but he was pretty great.\r\n\r\nSo far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I'd slot Captain America clean in the middle. I liked _Iron Man_ and _Thor_ more, but _Iron Man 2_ and _The Incredible Hulk_ less. Marvel Studios stated that the movie they wanted to make was set in the 40's, even though the rest of Marvel Cinematic is modern-day. This was 100% the right move to make, why? Not because of the setting, aesthetics or direction, but because it's fuckin' smart. How do you have the world appreciate an Uncle-Sam loving upper-middle class white male military blindly-loyal patriot? You make him fight the God damn Nazis, that's how.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange, but I actually enjoyed the opening of _Captain America_ the most, which he spends a a meek, asthmatic Steve Rogers, yet to undergo the Deus Ex Machina Super Serum. It really showed the best of Evans acting ability, as well as the writing of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely whom together wrote _You Kill Me_ and The _The Chronicles of Narnia_ Trilogy.\r\n\r\nI watched it in 3D, which was more bearable than usual. As the films of MCU progress, each of them becomes more and more a prequel to _The Avengers_, _Captain America_ being the most to date. Despite its almost-entire lack of _Avenger_ cameos, this more than previous films felt like a prequel for what's to come, which is not strictly speaking a good thing.\r\n\r\nI had plenty of minor issues with _Captain America_, and though their was quite a number of them, all were minor, and ultimately, the only part of me that regrets watching it was the part that keeps thinking \"My fucking God, I have to wait a YEAR before _Avengers_ comes out?!\"\r\n\r\n79%\r\n\r\n-Gimly", "PLOT\r\n\r\nSteve Rogers, a scrawny young man, wants to enlist in the US Army and go overseas to fight in WWII.

He's already brave and smart, so it would seem like a no-brainer to send him overseas? But the guy in charge of his training doesn't want him, he's just one man, so Rogers ends up doing public relations back home. And he is quite shocked that the men overseas don't react as positively when they see him as the crowds back home. I really enjoyed the way they handle the first battle scene for him, basically him figuring things out as he goes, a far cry from his battle-hardened approaches later.\r\n\r\nI even liked his interactions with Agent Carter. I had thought it would be more subtle than it was, and I hoped we'd see a bit more of her operating on her own (after all, they gave her character a whole series on TV!), but she was second fiddle to the hero.\r\n\r\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE\r\n\r\nThe challenge with a lot of American movies of the war is that it is as if they are the only actors in the war, no allies, just them, and that level of nationalistic narrowmindedness is a bit grating. That may be a small gripe when the show is called CAPTAIN AMERICA, not CAPTAIN OF WORKING WITH ALLIES, but still, it's annoying. I also was disappointed there wasn't a lot more on Red Skull. His history, his abilities, other pursuits, all of it was left basically unreferenced. Sure, some of it shows up elsewhere in the Marvel universe, but a bit more crosswalk would have been nice.

Order goes thusly;\r\n\r\n1. The Avengers\r\n2. Iron Man\r\n3. Thor\r\n4. Captain America\r\n5. Iron Man 2\r\n6. The Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it\u2019s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us\u2026 So worth it.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. \r\n\r\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau\u2019s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor\u2019s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn\u2019t a Thor movie, so we don\u2019t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year\u2019s Thor 2, it is very possible we\u2019ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki\u2019s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won\u2019t spoil it by telling you who they\u2019re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn\u2019t really drive the story at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers doesn\u2019t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn\u2019t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!\r\n\r\n90%\r\n\r\n-Gimly", "After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abysmal second instalment of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some \u201cdepth\u201d to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve always liked Robert Downey Jr\u2019s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he\u2019s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the \u201cpuny god\u201d scene (if you haven\u2019t seen the film yet you\u2019ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).\r\n\r\nI have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I\u2019m Scandinavian so\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much.", "One of the few movies to actually make me feel like a kid again, Joss Whedon was the perfect filmmaker to do this film. Everyone gets their time to shine. The script juggles every plot point and character moment with clarity and ease. It's funny, smart, and visually jaw dropping. Definitely lived up to the five movie hype.", "I give this 10 Stars based on it being not only better than the trailer and the hype made me thing it would be, but also that it was the first time anything the size and scope of the Marvel Cinematic universe was pulled off successfully. Having Joss direct this movie lives and dies on character interaction. This movie is on the definitive list in my opinion even just for that.", "Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.\r\n\r\nAsgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.\r\n\r\nI have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.\r\n\r\nFlaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10", "The Avengers is a dream movie come true for superhero fans with its group of extremely talented actors and epic champions, to create an action- packed movie with hilarious banter laced in between scenes.

So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.\r\n\r\nEverything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is \u2013 let's be honest \u2013 precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all \u2013 the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and \u2013 big shock \u2013 it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.\r\n\r\nWell, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.\r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.\r\n\r\nThis was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a filmmakers' case of \"could've, would've, should've\". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.\r\n\r\nNo story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad.\r\n_(June 2013)_", "This was probably the first time a movie has made me this angry in the theater.  It pissed me off then and it still pisses me off when it's on television.  If I could summarize this film in one word, it would be: obnoxious.  I wasn't really hyped for this film but I was expecting to have some fun since I did enjoy the previous Iron Man films.  This was the movie that made me start to dislike the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man (RDJ is still the man though).  Stark's narcissism had charm in the previous films but here, it made him into a complete idiot, dick, and coward. The Mandarin had potential to be an effective villain but the movie scraps him for a more lame villain than Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2.  The comedy was forced and annoying and the story has plot holes that were distracting.  I watched Thor 2 a while after this released but the taste from this movie was so bitter that even though I thought Thor 2 was alright, I just didn't want to see anymore films from this cinematic universe.  This movie is what killed the MCU for me.", "I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by this third instalment of the Iron Man series of movies. Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails is just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark\u2019s cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time. \r\n\r\nThe end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie.", "**A long form review originally posted in 2013**\r\n\r\n_Iron Man 3_ brings us into the so called \u201cPhase 2\u201d of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it does so in a flawed way. I\u2019ve said it before and reiterate it here, there is no such thing as a perfect film. But since _The Avengers_ set the bar so very high, following that up proved to simply be too much for Black\u2019s entry to handle.\r\n\r\nThere are a great deal of inconstancies, plot holes, stupid moves, illogical choices, and weak moments (though less than much of the internet would have you believe). These issues are not enough to lead to _Iron Man 3\u2019s_ complete and utter downfall, but they do force a sour taste into the piece overall.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s a bad movie though. In fact it\u2019s actually quite good. It surpasses the quality of _Iron Man 2_ and plants itself firmly in the MCU rather successfully. A move which only _The Incredible Hulk_ failed to make, but still. Yes it has its problems, yes we\u2019d hoped for better, and yes I\u2019ve got complaints, but the movie is not at all a failure. Manages to come full circle in a way that still leaves Tony Stark & Iron Man a future in the Marvel Universe.\r\n\r\nShane Black and Drew Pearce manage to bring in a sense of vulnerability that was barely touched on in the past MCU works. Even the minuscule Steve Rogers of _Captain America_ seemed in control of every situation. But here we see Tony Stark as not only a breakable man, but a man in general. The most human of any Super Hero appearance in the MCU to date. Yes the Robert Downey Jr. wit that all have come to expect from the piece is still on the table, but in between and beneath that there\u2019s an insomniac with extreme anxiety disorders living separated from the real world, too invested in his work and shattered identity to live as the Stark everyone expects him to still be.\r\n\r\nPepper and Rhodey are even given a chance to pick up the slack. The three form this sort of protagonist trinity, Saving one another in a round-robin Super Hero-y way with a little more depth than I\u2019d expected.\r\n\r\nThe _Iron Man_ movies famously have had the most disappointing bad-guy-show-downs in the genre. And though here Black gives us much more of a delivery on this front than Favreau ever did, the issues I had with _Iron Man 3_ came (almost) exclusively from A.I.M, the Mandarin and Extremis (which form the antagonist trinity now that I think of it).\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019ve got better a better final confrontation, but from less integral bad guys. A more human hero, stuck in a less human adventure. A better interlocking of characters, with less to do on screen. I could go on with this roller coaster, but that word essentially sums up the film. Not in that its a cliched \u201cthrill ride\u201d, but in that it\u2019s a constant mess of ups and downs, with the final destination just barely justifying the start point.\r\n\r\nSpeaking non-comparitively, _Iron Man 3_ makes a good movie. Not great. But so very, very worth the watch. It\u2019s hard for me to think objectively separate from the other films in the MCU, because I\u2019ve seen them all so many times that there\u2019s no way for me to forget all that\u2019s come before when watching the movie. I\u2019d be interested to hear from somebody who\u2019s watched _Iron Man 3_, but not _Iron Man 1_ & _2_ or _The Avengers_. I\u2019m sure such a person exists somewhere, and if so your input would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI think I might have made it seem as if I disliked Iron Man 3 more than I actually did. Here\u2019s why. From _Iron Man 2_ until _The Avengers_, I watched all the MCU films in cinemas. After each one, I immediately got that feeling of wanting to go back and watch it again, a feeling that steadily grew as time passed. Each film that Marvel released had me feeling this more strongly than the last, culminating in _The Avengers_ which I saw six times in theatres, and immediately pre-ordered the whole set on Blu-Ray the moment it became available (I bought a PS3 for the sole purpose of watching them). But with _Iron Man 3_ I sort of dropped back to a pretty low interest level once I\u2019d left Hoyts. It seemed that although it was a really good watch, it just didn\u2019t have the staying power I\u2019d come to expect from these incredible Super Hero films.\r\n\r\n67%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_", "I don't understand the hate for this one. The fact that Tony Stark is barely in the suit makes for an interesting take on analyzing the humanity of the character. I also found the villain plot twist halfway through the movie to be quite clever and surprisingly satisfying.\r\n\r\nIt certainly feels more like a Shane Black movie than an Iron Man movie, but that's a great thing. It shows Marvel is willing to give their filmmakers a voice and the room to take risks in their storytelling. Iron Man 3 is a very risky movie, and to me it paid off."], "76338": ["There have been plenty of movies based on classical cartoon superheroes that have been poorly implemented and with a lousy story. Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.\r\n\r\nThis one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so\u2026 Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.\r\n\r\nThe movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mj\u00f6lnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.", "More of the same. Predecible non elaborated script and with a total lack of sense of humor.\r\n\r\nThe FX are, again, OK, but the feeling of swords, axes, armors and helmets is of cheap plastic.", "Watching Thor: The Dark World tonight, I got the feeling that Hollywood might have finally figured it out. In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World\u2026 is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.\r\n\r\nThor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly \u2013 even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well \u2013 they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.\r\n\r\nThe actors all wear their roles like a custom-made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki \u2013 personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin\u2026 Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him \u2013 you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.\r\n\r\nAll the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done. \r\n\r\nStill, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her\u2026 Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in-distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with \"three degrees in physics\" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. \r\n\r\nThor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact \u2013 at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods \u2013 this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men\u2026 Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.\r\n_(November 2013)_", "**A long format review from 2013**\r\n\r\nDespite a virtually non-existent (comparatively) promotional campaign for Marvel\u2019s latest effort, Thor: The Dark World has crushed its competition box-office-wise. Though receiving less critical acclaim than Captain Phillips or Gravity, it did clean up in the finance department.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that in the MCU, my favourite Avenger is Thor, so a new film was always going to be an easy ticket from me. And I can\u2019t work out if that bias is making me more critical of the film because I care so much, or less because I\u2019m just happy it got made? I\u2019ll try to be as above board as possible.\r\n\r\nThor 2 is a spectacle, make no mistake. It has the appropriate mix of explosions, attractive people, monsters, humour, fighting, mesmerising visuals, sweet symbolism and heart-wrenching sorrow that can be expected from a decent super hero film. But beyond that, it doesn\u2019t really have much.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds like it has a lot, and it honestly does, but I just couldn\u2019t help feeling in a quite a number of moments that the thing felt hurried. Maybe if there wasn\u2019t such a mad rush to get a Thor sequel out by the end of 2013, they could have spent a little more time fleshing out and filling in the script (not that it\u2019s a short movie, I mean the pre-production feels rushed) and better utilising director Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones, Rome, Carnivale).

It's just far more clich\u00e9 than its predecessors, and that's disappointing.", "I don't understand all the hate surrounding this movie.

If superheroes and action, plenty of action, is within your sphere of interest then this movie truly delivers. There is even a story to support the stunts and special effects fireworks that is not too shabby. As a matter of fact, for being a Marvel-based movie, the story is more than acceptable.\r\n\r\nAs the blurb states, our hero is meeting a few adaptation issues after having been awaken into the modern world. Luckily the movie do not fall into the trap of making some silly comedy out of it but keeps these parts at a reasonable level where it stays funny without ruining the movie or disrupting the pace of the real story.\r\n\r\nThe story? Simple and not very original with the usual slew of traitors strewn about, you cannot trust anyone, our hero becomes a fugitive etc etc bla bla bla. It is however a pretty straightforward one which works quite well and is not getting bogged down in silly emotions and general idiotic behavior by our hero like for instance several instalments of Spider Man have done. Actually this is one thing that I really like with this movie. The hero is a true hero from start to finish without any of that modern Hollywood crap where the hero must be tarnished in one way or another to satisfy the directors and producers.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above if you like superhero action movies then there is little not to like with this one. Acceptable story, plenty of action, good special effects, a cool chick (hey I am but an ordinary male, I like female actors in tight costumes) and a clear hero. None of the actors are really doing a bad job of it and in general the acting is as good as one can expect when portraying characters that, after all, are be totally ludicrous in real life. Its 8 out of 10 rating at IMDb (at the time of writing this) is well deserved. I am astonished that some people seem to have voted it down with a one star rating. It is a Marvel-based movie. You might feel it is more or less good but the style of the movie should not really be a major surprise to anyone and there is no way in hell that it deserves a one star rating unless someone really watched the wrong movie by accident.", "Put *a little* bit of brain in a superhero's movie script and you will have everybody talking wonders about it.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad movie but neither astonishing.

Well\u2026they both were dead \u2013 not really \u2013 but now they are both alive. But one of them can\u2019t remember who he really is. In this film we get to do this with two characters instead of one.  It\u2019s not a huge distraction but why does Marvel keep returning to this plot line? \r\n\r\nEND OF MINOR SPOILER ALERT\r\n\r\nThe Winter Soldier is best when Rogers and Romanoff are on the move trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. The explosions are nice, the action scenes are intense but the real enjoyment of the film is where skill and wits are relied on more than gadgets and explosions. \r\n\r\nPatriotism is a bit more nuanced this time around and it's better for it.  The cast is great, no awkward acting moments to report. It\u2019s a great summer flick with all the action you want.", "Till the end of the road.\r\n\r\nStonking! Now this is more like it, after the disappointments that have been Iron Man 2 and Thor 2, Captain America gets a sequel of substance and sparks. It manages to blend everything required to make a great superhero film, lashings of derring-do heroics, action bonanza, adventure, some sexy sizzle and of course the key, a story with brains and mystery elements.\r\n\r\nTrue enough to say that the considerable contributions of Black Widow and Falcon (and Nick Fury of course) keeps this as a lively Avengers spin-off movie, which is no bad thing at all, but it's still the Captain who dominates things, marking himself out as a viable main man. In fact the whole film has the old school comic book feel, yes there's the grandiose pyrotechnics - unsurprisingly amped up for the big finale, but there's an adherence to serial thriller conventions that is, well, rather warm and comforting.\r\n\r\nWith the Captain getting some surprising amount of emotional depth and humanity courtesy of the perfectly cast Chris Evans, the viewers have much to care about. Themes of Bondian world domination and global security crisis keep things nice and fanciful, while the unheralded work by the effects guys is modern cinematic art. There's some adherence to genre formula, and a bit of Marvel universe copy-catting going on, but this is one of the best films from the Marvel stable. A rich sequel indeed - more Captain America please. 9/10", "**A long format review from 2014**\r\n\r\nMisleadingly, the titular Winter Soldier is essentially a minor subplot in what is more of an espionage-technoir-thriller meets spectacle-epic than your typical super hero film. The real meat of the movie, thankfully, has some more substance behind it. Though it wouldn't surprise me if we learn later that Sebastian Stan's villain was forced to take a back seat via last minute script changes \u00e0 la Hawkeye in _The Avengers_.\r\n\r\nThese things are of course a matter of opinion, and I'd like to watch _Winter Soldier_ at least once more (particularly in 2D... God do I ever hate 3D) before committing to any particular ranking. But even without that, I feel confident in saying it's the best MCU Phase 2 film to date. We must await _Guardians of The Galaxy_ and _Age of Ultron_ before cementing that little award, but I'd say that it stands at the very least above _Iron Man 3_ and _The Dark World_.\r\n\r\nI always try to keep my reviews spoiler free, but being that in most parts of the world it isn't out yet, I'll be extra careful to do so with this one. This makes talking about _Winter Soldier_ on its own merits difficult, but there are certainly a few things that can be said.\r\n\r\nChris Evans (Cap'), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and to a slightly lesser extent. Anthonie Mackie (Falcon) rule the film, and do so without any shortcomings. That's not to say that they couldn't physically have done any better, but their roles were all seamless as far as my blurred vision could tell, which is not an accolade I'd often give.\r\n\r\nWhere _The Dark World_ was simply a holding pattern for Thor with some very pretty pictures, _Iron Man 3_ and _The Winter Soldier_ went out and took some actual risks in their stories. But unlike _Iron Man 3's_, Winter Soldier's risks have (to its eternal credit) been universally well received.\r\n\r\nDirectors Joe and Anthony Russo also managed to cameo a couple of Community alumni, which will never be a bad thing in my eyes, even if they're just one-off, throwaway jokes.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I really feel I need to give _The Winter Soldier_ at the very least one more screening before I feel totally confident in my thoughts about it.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that I'm really fucking excited for that second viewing speaks in its favour if nothing else does.\r\n\r\n86%\r\n\r\n_-Gimly_", "Captain America: The Winter Soldier opens up with an action sequence that's better than most action movie climaxes. It then sets up a really intriguing story before launching into one of the most suspenseful car chases since the Simpson/Bruckheimer 90s era. After that it's scene after scene of amazing action coupled with a complex story about heroes and villains being caught in a system that is too big to bring down, unless you're as good and level headed as Steve Rogers.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just a great comic book movie. It's a great movie; period. Using a spy thriller style mixed with martial arts and gunplay, set to the perfect music score, I would rank The Winter Soldier as one of my favourite action films hands down."], "118340": ["This movie was so AWESOME! I loved it all and i had a bad day before watching it but it turned it around. I love action packed movies and this was great.", "Really funny and with great spcial effects. Probably, one of the movies not to miss this year.", "I \u039bM G\u042f\u04e8\u04e8\u01ac!", "This was a pleasant surprise of a movie, full of great humor as well as an intriguing story.  It's quick and zany at times.  Think <em>Psych</em> in space (back when Psych was funny).  The pace is quick and the story line is easy to pick up and follow.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the film work is something that early Lucas and Joss Whedon understand:  great sci-fi movies are really westerns at heart.  There is a relationship with nature, a broken, compromised hero, a deep necessity for teamwork, and the story happens OUT there in the wild.  <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> has ALL of this.  \r\n\r\n<em>Guardians</em> is already set up for a sequel so we will see if Marvel can continue the magic.  It's a great addition to the Marvel universe.", "Like most of the reviews here, I agree that Guardians of the Galaxy was an absolute hoot. Guardians never takes itself too seriously which makes this movie a whole lot of fun.\r\n\r\nThe cast was perfectly chosen and even though two of the main five were CG, knowing who voiced and acted alongside them completely filled out these characters.\r\n\r\nGuardians of the Galaxy is one of those rare complete audience pleasers. Good fun for everyone!", "The thing about this film when I first saw it, was the incredible juxtaposition of sadness, humor and courage. Great acting! The music is superb. That Sony Walkman must be the best bit of brand advertising ever engaged by a company within a film. The film should appeal to a broad range of viewers.", "This movie is more of a comedy than anything else. It is truly a comic magazine brought to life on the big screen and more focused on delivering a sequence of action scenes and laughs than anything intelligent in the form of plot or characters. I would say it is a movie for the younger audience and comic fans. Having said that I must admit that I found it rather fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe main characters are two mostly irresponsible rascals, one dumb but likable living tree and two fanatics of which one certainly need not apply to the Mensa club. Of the five I liked Rocket and Gamora the best. Rocket is a rather likable rascal and Gamora is simply cool. Quill is sometimes just silly, Groot is more of a living prop and Drax is just too stupid.\r\n\r\nThe story is more or less just there to tie the scenes together. Unfortunately we do really not get much of a background to the Guardians of The Galaxy universe. It would have been nice to get a bit more understanding of why things are as they are etc. The return of this movie is watching the action, the special effects and the laughs. It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie\u2019s tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie. The same can be said for that cool but weird net they made by interlinking fighter crafts.\r\n\r\nOn the whole an entertaining movie. I have to say that the dancing scene at the end was a wee bit too silly for me though. I have a problem understanding how a movie like this can get such a relatively high rating at IMDb but okay it was fun to watch and it is not entirely undeserved. Personally I think a 7 out of 10 is more in the right region.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:", "**A long form review originally posted n 2014:**\r\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve given _Guardians_ a BluRay watch through, I feel more comfortable reviewing it. I saw it on the first day of its Australian cinematic release, but I wasn\u2019t sure what I thought. I watched it again and still wasn\u2019t sure, but now that it\u2019s six months later, I am sure.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a massive fan of director James Gunn. Come to think of it, I\u2019m also also a big fan of Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Chris Pratt, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Honsou, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Peter Serafinowicz, Alexis Denisof, Rob Zombie and Nathan Fillion, and they\u2019re all in this. Not to mention I\u2019m an absolute sucker for the MCU. So after hearing that a very decent chunk of the fanbase thinking that not only was this the best Marvel film of the year (going up against _Winter Soldier_ and _Days of Future Past_), but that they would then go on to say it was the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film ever, you could imagine I was very surprised to find that I actually didn\u2019t think it was all that great.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want people thinking I didn\u2019t like it. I did. In fact I will go on record saying that it was miles away from their worst film, and if I\u2019m being honest they handled the last 25 minutes (arguably the most important part) of the film absolutely spectacularly. But I didn\u2019t get the magic that everyone was telling me about. How this was the film for the new generation.  I didn\u2019t even get the sense of satisfaction that I had in Cap\u2019s movie just a few months previous.\r\n\r\nSo many things seemed under utilised, but I don\u2019t know what you could have cut to make room for the extra things I wanted. Which means the only way to get it is to have a longer film. It\u2019s already two hours, and a longer movie means a bigger budget and less screenings. ie. more money going out and less money coming in. And at the end of the day Disney is a business, and they have to make their money the best way they think they can. So I understand why it wasn\u2019t perfect for me, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from feeling _Guardians_ is a mite overrated. Good damn movie. But overrated.\r\n\r\nPersonally I\u2019d stick it somewhere in the middle of the MCU\u2019s releases thus far. Leaps and bounds above _The Incredible Hulk_, _The Dark World_ and _Iron Man 2_, but not so beloved as the likes of _The Avengers_, _Winter Soldier_ or _Iron Man 1_.\r\n\r\n73%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_", "Guardians of the Galaxy is a gorgeous and wonderfully entertaining space opera. The characters are so damn lovable, the world building is incredible, the soundtrack gives the film an entirely unique feel, and the effects are astoundingly first rate.\r\n\r\nThe story follows the pattern of the space fantasies that influenced George Lucas, but the presentation is the work of the extraordinarily gifted filmmaker James Gunn. If we ever forget that the MCU was ever a thing (we won't but let's just be hypothetical), many generations will still be talking about this fantastic movie."], "99861": ["There is a lot going on in this movie but it all just seemed kind of pointless and dull to me. Every now and then there would be a good scene or piece of dialogue but for the most part I felt myself getting bored and reaching for my phone to play Cribbage. I guess what I didn't like most is that it all felt like a big filler episode instead of an action packed character driven story arc.", "Action, good Fx and a \"not-completely-absurd\" story. The actors perform well and you can identify them very well with their characters ... but it is all old and without imagination.\r\n\r\nI suppose nobody was expecting anything else, though ...", "This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another \u201cstandard\u201d comic book villain a\u2019 la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well.", "**A long form review originally posted in 2015:**\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.\r\n\r\nI lost my steam on the _Age of Ultron_ wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I\u2019m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t harp on too much, because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn\u2019t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It\u2019s not the best superhero film of all time, it\u2019s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it\u2019s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important here. But what do I mean by that? \r\n\r\nWell, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. \r\n\r\nEvery new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.\r\n\r\nSo if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they\u2019ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that\u2019s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It\u2019s what\u2019s not in _Age of Ultron_ that\u2019s the problem.\r\n\r\nJoss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I\u2019m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can\u2019t say it more plainly than that: It\u2019s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn\u2019t stand alone the first film did. It\u2019s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can\u2019t fully get behind it.\r\n\r\nThat all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can\u2019t state that enough. And there\u2019s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I\u2019m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).\r\n\r\n75%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_", "The fact that Joss Whedon was able to salvage some sort of coherent film out of all he was forced to cram into a single movie is quite commendable. But the sad fact is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is really just a run of the mill \"bad guy wants to destroy the world for reasons\" actioner that we've seen done better many times before.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. The movie's fun. The dialogue is frequently clever and humourous. And I really appreciated the quiet bits of storytelling that Whedon was able to sneak in. It's just that at the end of the day, the villain is weak sauce, there's way too much set up for other movies, and if I'm criticizing Man of Steel for having excessive destruction, I can't give Avengers a pass since they needlessly blow up not one, not two, but three cities. Pretty sure many insurance agencies went bankrupt paying out all the victims.", "Movie was great but felt like there was just too much action and fighting. The creativity of the choreography gets lost in the whirlwind of action and this I noticed most in Captain America's scenes. He does like a hundred different awesome things with his shield, but you don't have time to really take it in because you're already looking at Iron Man blasting 20 Ultron-bots to bits.", "This is the movie where Captain America became my favorite Avenger. Sure he doesn't have monstrous abilities like Iron Man and Hulk, but to be holding his own on the same ground as them is just a testament to how great of a hero he truly is.", "It has become a well-known fact that coming out with a sequel that's better than, if not on par with, the first one is an insane task. But kudos to Marvel for staying true to their colors with this sequel.", "I expected more from Quicksilver.  He would've been a great addition to the Avengers.", "The thing that puzzles me is that in this film, Vision is presented to be a powerful hero, having the mind stone and all. But on the next films, he's become more of like a side character that just wasn't relevant anymore except for that little piece of stone on his forehead. Shame.", "I'm glad to see that they found another role for Hawkeye other than being that one guy who seemed to be trying hard to keep up with the other more powerful heroes on the team. Now he's more of like the thing that keeps the team together and it suits his character well.", "Movie was great but felt like there was just too much action and fighting.

Overall outstanding performance by everyone both on and off screen.", "Despite the challenge of having to top their first Avengers film, Marvel did beautifully and the result was amazing. I hope to see more films like this in the future."], "102899": ["I loved it it was so much fun and very funny, another marvel masterpiece", "When one thinks of a typical super-hero actioner, they imagine the boisterous boundaries that are associated with such an explosive genre: eye-popping special effects, outlandish and grand-standing villains, world domination escapades, complex yet flashy super-heroes that seem unreal and unapologetic and a big scale of unbelievable escapism that is tellingly becoming of a comic book epic on the big screen for the hungry eyes of the giddy moviegoer. Remember, all these described elements are not a bad thing when it comes to larger than life comic book/superhero fantasies. In fact, we almost insist that our volt-minded vehicles have some kinetic kick to its pulsating, pithy adventures. After all, there is certainly nothing wrong with that approach to the cinematic sensationalism of summertime popcorn pleasers and the costumed heroes that take us on that daring, rollicking ride of magical mayhem.\r\n\r\nHowever, director Peyton Reed\u2019s \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 symbolizes a different texture and tone to the familiar action-packed world of Marvel Comics\u2019 outrageous universe both on the printed pages and in the dark movie theaters. It does not necessarily use the overwrought or ultra-stimulating tactics to sell its percolating product as a super-charged heroic fable of mighty manipulators out to save the planet in the tradition of frantic favorites such as \u2018The Avengers\u2019 film franchise for instance. Instead, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 relies on its small and intimate take of quirkiness, introspection, a gentle doomsday message of despair and a measurement of an awkward man that wears his bugged-out wardrobe with a sense of curiosity and conviction. In essence, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 is a costumed caper that is high-spirited in its low-key excitement\u2026something quite refreshing and revered in the wild and wacky world of Marvel Comics\u2019 representation of the super-studs and sasses that invade our cinematic sensibilities in the hazy days of summer.\r\n\r\n\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 lead Paul Rudd, an affable actor that has shown various levels of competence in both comedies and dramas over the years, is the unlikely source to don an ant-oriented attire and let his charm and cheekiness take over as the tiny bugged-eyed avenger of right and might. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former troubled lawbreaker and gifted engineer whose demons come back to haunt him when he gets involved in the burglary shenanigans with his bad news buddies (T.I. and Michael Pena). The reason for Lang\u2019s lure back to crime: a cockeyed but convenient way to win over the affections of his estranged young daughter.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, another great analytical mind of mechanics and science in stand-offish Hank Pym (Oscar-winner Michael Douglas) is spotlighted as he too struggles to relate to his daughter as well in the pretty Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Anyhow, Pym has a colorful backstory as it is revealed that he used to save the world from harm as the underrated crime-fighter Ant-Man. There was no glory or special recognition for Pym\u2019s heroics as the buggy super-hero but his devotion to his crime-stopping craft was realized nevertheless.\r\n\r\nAs ANT-MAN Paul Rudd's Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminnal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed's modest costume caper.\r\nAs ANT-MAN Paul Rudd\u2019s Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed\u2019s modest costume caper.\r\nThe conflicted father-daughter tandem of Pym and Hope eventually recruit the beleaguered Lang to climb into the exo-skeletal red-and-black suit and become the current Ant-Man to continue the mission of promoting goodness over evil. In this specific case, Lang\u2019s Ant-Man is asked to foil the nefarious agenda of Pym\u2019s former protege and associate Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) who threatens to expose the revolutionary shrinking technology to anyone sinister that offers him an insane and immediate price for such secretive scientific information that could jeopardize mankind in the long run. Of course, it goes without saying, that Cross has an ominous alter-ego in the vile Yellowjacket whose back-and-forth clashing with Lang\u2019s Ant-Man leads to the calculating and corrosive chess game of one skillful insidious insect trying to outwit and outmaneuver a conscientious one.\r\n\r\nSome may dismiss \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 as being too low-grade, cheesy and incidental in its confrontational canvas of saints versus sinners. Still, Reed\u2019s handling of his Marvel-inspired \u2018battle of the bugs\u2019 is a winning formula in simplicity because it does not have to be rooted in a spectacular and showy landscape as the other successful bombastic blockbusters that come out of the frivolous factory of Hollywood. Essentially, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 demonstrates the right kind of personality and prestige for its presentation as a scaled-down comic book actioner steeped in the personalized disillusionment of the characterizations and their assorted psyches. Sure, \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 will not let anyone forget its popular competitor in the much glorified and iconic standing of another insect-fighting Marvel mastermind in \u2018Spider-Ma\u2019n anytime soon. Yet Scott Lang\u2019s Ant-Man is just as angst-ridden, impish, awkward and devoted as Peter Parker\u2019s resilient web-headed wonder Spidey.   \r\n\r\nThe drama unfolds so convincingly in \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 not so much because of the dire dilemma of comicbook goodness and badness but because of the examination of deteriorating relations between broken men and their families or more specifically between fathers and daughters. Both Rudd and Douglas are committed to their roles as the Ant-Men that saved the world with ease past and present but could not say the same thing about rescuing the domestic responsibilities that eluded them under their own roofs. As Lang tries to find an opening for forgiveness toward his little girl and remarried ex-wife (Judy Greer), his current adviser Pym struggles to put the pieces together with a disgruntled Hope that blames her father for the neglect of her well-being as well as the death of her beloved late mother known as the Wasp, a super-heroine that shined in her own shadow of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 is a soulfully weird, witty sliced-down spectacle of a comicbook film that is rare in its skin to deliver the message of a connection not just to stamping out the cartoonish crime and chaos that is routinely found in the playful playground of Marvel\u2019s movie machine of high-powered personalities armed with skillful brute and brilliance. It also has something called heart and hope as it tackles the alienation and isolation of fathers and their vulnerable daughters. It will take more than a gigantic can of Raid to destroy the indomitable presence of \u2018Ant-Man\u2019 and what his hedonistic heroics, both physical and psychological, bring to the prized picnic table.\r\n\r\nAnt-Man (2015)\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Studios\r\n\r\n1 hr. 57 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Crey Stall, Michael Pena, Tip \u201cT.I.\u201d Harris, Judy Greer, Bobby Cannavale, Wood Harris and Abby Ryder Fortson\r\n\r\nDirected by: Peyton Reed\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Comic Book Fantasy, Super-heroes, Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)", "The Pocket Rocket.\r\n\r\nGiven the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be.

A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.\r\n\r\nThe effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity.

So I'm glad they brought cinematic version of 'Ant-man' and I'm sure he'll return to the next 'Avengers' as they promoted strongly in this film itself to know what would be the audience response. I don't know others, but I definitely welcome the idea.\r\n\r\nAnother CGI magic, another Marvel's wonder. As long as they pick the right cast and crew with a good story, the sci-fi like this continues to rule the cinema world. It was a great team work, that must be appreciated. As usual the top notch visuals as well the performances, even the sidekicks. But I was surprised to see when Paul Rudd was attached to this project. I believed it would be a comedy sci-fi packed with full of action, and I was wrong. It was a simple tale, a heist theme and of course it was fun to watch, but never was a comedy movie.\r\n\r\nA wonderful beginning, especially for the first film in the series. You know strong foundation is the key to raise a building above. I know the sequels would only get better by progressing and it should be. Because in all the Marvel's superhero flicks, this one was the most family and young kids friendly. That does not mean there were no violence, but from the title to the characters and presentation, all were so casual and can be understood by all.\r\n\r\nIt was so great to see a legend like Michael Douglas to be a part in the modern movie. Now I am eager to see Evangeline Lily as Wasp-girl in the follow-up. It would be like Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, but in a sci-fi version. The extras were very interesting, I enjoyed them as well. If you're are yet to see the film, don't expect anything like Disney's 'Honey' trilogy, after all, if you enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) then you would do same for it which is the twelfth to follow.\r\n\r\n7.5/10", "I like Paul Rudd and was hoping this would be as funny as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' but it wasn't. It looked good and the direction was solid but I think it suffered from the constant screenplay rewrites that the film underwent by changing the screenwriters (Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish).\r\n\r\nI also felt it was a bit too long-winded and it was unbalanced. However, the main good feature in this film was the special effects.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605", "I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.\r\n\r\nHaving said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit \u201cwhat the f\u2026\u201d when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children\u2019s room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.\r\n\r\nI really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion.", "Less spectacle than most MCU films have been serving up, particularly in phase two, but the story and characterisation is actually a little stronger than the past couple of tales Marvel has served up.\r\n\r\nVillain Darren Cross, AKA \u201cYellowjacket\u201d (originally a hero in the comics) lacks the onscreen presence of top tier Marvel-evil Loki, but is certainly one of the stronger offerings the MCU has given us. His twisted relationship with his former mentor gives another level to this Marvel film not seen since _Winter Soldier_.\r\n\r\nNot so much a super hero film as a super heist film, _Ant-Man_ was a welcome refreshment to the comic book movie party, and though I always like to give myself some time to find exactly where MCU films fit in my overall experience, at the moment I would say _Ant-Man_ sits somewhere comfortably in the middle, maybe even a bit below, but is still well worth a watch, even for those who aren\u2019t deeply involved with the film series as a whole.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._", "***Ant-Man?***  \r\n\r\nReleased in 2015, \"Ant-Man\" stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who is offered redemption and the opportunity to be a hero. Michael Douglas plays his mentor, Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly Pym's daughter; meanwhile Corey Stoll co-stars as the heavy.\r\n\r\nIn my vast arsenal of old comics I have only one issue where Ant-Man is the main star: Marvel Feature #10, which featured Hank Pym as the hero, not to mention his wife, the Wasp, AKA Janet van Dyne. The character's run in that comic ceased with that very issue. By the 80s Scott Lang, a good-intentioned thief, became Ant-Man after stealing Pym's Ant-Man suit to save his daughter. With the encouragement of Pym, Lang became Ant-Man full-time.\r\n\r\nThe movie is based on these events and I was surprised at how entertaining it is considering how relatively minor the hero is. The movie even makes a joke about this when Ant-Man comes face-to-face with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Speaking of which, it's great to see the Falcon in action. It's also great to see Yellowjacket who, in the comics, was Hank Pym after Lang took over as Ant-Man. In the movie Yellowjacket is the villain (Stoll), which is okay since Pym's Yellowjacket in the comics sort of became a villain when he had a mental breakdown and was eventually divorced by Janet, the Wasp. The filmmakers incidentally did an excellent job with the Yellowjacket suit.\r\n\r\n\"Ant-Man\" was a surprise hit at the box office and understandably so. It's a quality superhero flick done with style and brimming with confidence. It's nothing more than this, but that's all it needs to be. It's nice to see Michael Douglas who was, believe-it-or-not, 70 years-old during shooting. He shines in the movie as Pym and could easily pass for ten years younger. I also really liked the Quantum Realm sequence when Lang is reduced to microscopic size.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Georgia and San Francisco, CA. ADDITIONAL CAST: Judy Greer, Bobby Cannavale and Michael Pe\u00f1a.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-", "Ant-Man is a much needed breath of fresh air from all the city-breaking, galaxy saving epicness of the past five Marvel movies. It's a nice, light, fun heist movie with some pretty cool effects and a great cast of characters.\r\n\r\nMichael Pena, T.I. and David Dastmalchian make this movie so much more enjoyable. Not that Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Corey Still aren't great, but those three as a sidekick trio crack me up.\r\n\r\nEdgar Wright's stamp is all over this movie and it's a shame his directorial touch is missing, because he would have known what to remove to make it even better.\r\n\r\nBut all in all, Ant-Man is great entertainment with a feel good story about a man trying to be the hero his kid thinks he is."], "271110": ["Well another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans\u2019s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Iron Man.\r\n\r\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\r\n\r\nSo what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\r\n\r\nLeading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross\u2019s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\r\n\r\nFor Stark/Iron Man\u2019s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man\u2019s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son\u2019s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man\u2019s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team\u2019s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nOn top of Captain America\u2019s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier\u2019s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes\u2026Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him\u2013mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).\r\n\r\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous \u201cCaptain America: Winter Soldier\u201d) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who\u2019s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans\u2019s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film\u2019s title one cannot overlook Downey\u2019s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans\u2019s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan\u2019s killing culprit as well as Boseman\u2019s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.\r\n\r\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\r\n\r\n**Captain America: Civil War (2016)**\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs 26 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Bruhl, Alfre Woodward, William Hurt\r\n\r\nDirected by: Anthony Russo and Joe Russo\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Superheroes Saga/Action and Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng**", "The Russo Brother's and Marvel did it again! Read my full review here!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hweird1reviews.com/allreviews/captain-america-civil-war-review", "**The heroes're divided and so the fans!**\r\n\r\nBefore watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.\r\n\r\nI think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?\r\n\r\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\r\n\r\nI want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only \u201cincriminating\u201d the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the\u00a0United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.\r\n\r\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe few redeeming qualities\u00a0of this movie\u00a0is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\r\n\r\nTechnically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie.", "Good movie, love Captain American.", "<b>A long form review originally posted in 2016</b>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie, that\u2019s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil War_.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, it\u2019s hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so for starters, I\u2019ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It\u2019s insane.\r\n\r\n_Winter Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad brush of characterisation to be solely a \u201c_Captain America_\u201d movie.\r\n\r\nConsidering the sheer scope of the piece, it\u2019s amazing that the Russo brothers managed to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I\u2019m hunting for flaws, that to some degree is one.\r\n\r\nI will say, that for all of _Civil War\u2019s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into Marvel\u2019s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\r\n\r\n_Civil War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By that, I don\u2019t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel \u201cCivil War\u201d event from back 2006, because that\u2019s not even close to true. What I mean is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\r\n\r\nOh yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They\u2019ve got me pretty bloody excited.\r\n\r\n79%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_", "The Captain America movies have managed to ground the MCU by exploring the political and social climate created by the Avengers' existence. Actions have consequences and consequences influence more action.\r\n\r\nCivil War isn't as focused as The Winter Soldier. It's also overstuffed with characters and fan service. However, the movie works by always being intriguing. Both sides of the conflict are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability isn't anything new (explored in Watchmen and The Dark Knight), but it's nice to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe. Also, Captain Zemo is a better than average villain because while underdeveloped, his motive is interesting and not just \"destroy the world.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, SPIDER-MAN IS FINALLY IN THE MCU!!!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01"], "284052": ["With each new Marvel film one could expect the studio to push the limits of what a superhero film should consist of. Films such as Captain America: Winter Solider, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man all consisted of elements that we have never seen within a superhero film before. Now, Marvel Studios attempts to push the envelop once more by leaving the world of high tech armors and super soldiers and entering the mystical world of magic. Leading this charge is Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Stephen Strange and hopefully he could answer why there is this strange mystical feeling that we have seen this all before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> From Marvel comes \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place\u2014a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange\u2014armed with newly acquired magical powers\u2014is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.\r\n\r\nI am going to start off the review by discussing the only strong positive thing that came out of Doctor Strange and its by far the visuals. Beautiful vibrant colors pop at you throughout the film, the costume design is beyond extravagant and the framing is spot on. Doctor Strange and his fellow Sorcerers Supremes powers aren't fully on display until they enter the Mirror Dimension and my god, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner would hate this place. As they are men of science, they would hate that all rules of physics are thrown out the window as our Sorcerers Supremes are capable of breaking buildings apart and reforming to however they please. It is hard to not reference Inception but no one here is dreaming, these visuals are being created by the hand of mystical men and they use it to their power.\r\n\r\nIn all honestly, pushing the envelope when it comes to visuals was not a difficult task at all. Heck, if they didn't I would have been extremely disappointed as it was an obvious opportunity to take advantage of since we are dealing with magic. I am still extremely disappointed regardless as director Scott Derrickson completely missed another obvious opportunity to push the envelope this time in regards of character development.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stephen Strange is very much like a Tony Stark and other superheroes we have seen in films before as he is arrogant, egoistical and full of it. After Strange's accident in which he suffered extreme nerve damage to both hands, he dishes out every penny to his name to repair his hands in hopes he could continue his career as neurosurgeon. Every attempt fails and Strange becomes desperate enough to head to Nepal and finds himself under the guidance of Tilda Swinton's The Ancient One. Learning a whole new concept in the mystic arts forces Strange to reshape his way of thinking but Scott Derrickson does not let this have Strange reshape who he is as a person as well.\r\n\r\nDoctor Strange should have found himself being more like a Steve Rogers towards the end of the film as learning the mystic arts and his accident alone should have broken his ego. But instead everything still comes easy to him as he masters magic with ease with very little tension. He has a couple hiccups in the beginning but once The Ancient One puts him under her wing it is smooth sailing and Strange is stealing texts, wielding powerful weapons and defeating Supremes with decades of training with ease.\r\n\r\nYou cannot say that Strange was destined for the mystic arts and that is why everything came so easy for him. Strange is only learning the mystic arts due to circumstance. If he doesn't get into an accident, which happened to him due to being careless, he doesn't find himself in Nepal. Harry Potter was destined for magic, not Strange. Strange fails to grow as a character because he continues to be proven right and no consequences seem to happen due to his actions.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get into the character development of our supporting characters Benedict Wong's Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo as I would utterly spoil the film for you. All I would say though is that they were both mishandled and deserved better developments. It is a shame too because Wong and Ejiofor are superb actors but wasting talent is something Marvel Studios is used to.\r\n\r\nWhen will Marvel Studios get a villain right?  With Mads Mikkelsen playing our lead villain, Kaecilius, I thought we might finally get a cinematic Marvel villain that is on par to Killgrave and Kingpin over at Marvel's television department. Ultimately, Kaecilius and Doctor Strange end up fighting due to the most silliest cliche: being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The two individuals meet at the New York Sanctum Sanctorum in which Strange accidentally gets blown in to. Kaecilius is there to kill the protector and Sanctum Sanctorum itself and has no knowledge of who Strange is. In fact, he honestly believes Strange's name is in fact \"Mister Doctor.\" Still learning his craft, Strange is capable of putting up a better fight than the protector who should be a matter. I mean, he is a protector after all. There are no stakes for Strange, strange.\r\n\r\nVisually appealing could only get you so far as Doctor Strange fails to focus on the development of their characters that they made so appealing to the eye. Doctor Strange will become a huge asset to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and lets hope we see the rest of Strange's development when he casts his next spell. There is so much untapped potential in Strange's character, we just haven't seen the best of him yet.", "All continues to be well in the Marvel Comics Universe as the film adaptation of another mischievous and majestic superhero from Stan Lee\u2019s printed page empire emerges and reigns supreme on the big screen. The latest cure from the Marvel movie bag of explosive tricks is the entry of the dazzling and decorative **Doctor Strange**. Armed with a collection of notable performers, a convincing colorful scope of visual vibrancy and a hearty touch of spiritual and reflective potency the spellbinding **Doctor Strange** is an engaging and oddly sophisticated action-oriented comic book fantasy adding imaginative flavor to the typical escapist gem from the Marvel stable of powered personalities.\r\n\r\nSome may argue that **Doctor Strange** is merely another conveyor belt cinematic comics confection that follows a safe and similar makeup that constitutes the obligatory Marvel Comics movie foundation\u2013excitable weirdness, overly splashes of wayward whimsy, copious characterizations attached to their brand of eccentric grandeur and larger-than-life gestures of dark and devious exploits grounded in the basic landscape of good versus evil. Listen, sometimes traveling down the conventional path of constructed and adventurous Marvel-made spectacles is not necessarily a bad thing to consider. After all, the well-known and more popular superhero icons such as _Spider-Man_, _The Incredible Hulk_, _Iron Man_, _The Avengers_, and _The X-Men_ for instance seem to benefit nicely from the anticipated formula that routinely delivers the entertaining goods for its avid core of fanboys. So why not wipe off the seemingly obscure and underrated **Doctor Strange** and provide the same kind of popcorn-pulsating mystique for blockbuster cinema?\r\n\r\n**Doctor Strange** started out as a comic book creation in 1963 by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee. Director Scott Derrickson (\u201cParadise Lost\u201d, \u201cThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\u201d, \u201cSinister\u201d, \u201cDeliver Us From Evil\u201d) does an admirable job in giving shades of bizarre brilliance and magical manipulation to an unconventional Marvel comic book character hardly known for his capacity to translate his mystical mastery to celluloid with compelling curiosity. Derrickson, known primarily for his creative juices in the realm of horror fantasies, confidently serves up the off-kilter and hypnotic appeal of Dr. Stephen Strange as embodied by accomplished English actor Benedict Cumberbatch (\u201cBlack Mass\u201d, \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d, \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d). Interestingly, Derrickson and his handful of screenwriters craft **Doctor Strange** with a mind-blowing measurement of restraint and inquisitiveness. Indeed, **Doctor Strange** echoes its contemporary Marvel-established movies with predictable pluckiness to a certain extent but what is appreciated more is the uniqueness of the film\u2019s ability to emphasize a cerebral superhero that is cut out of a different kind of creative cloth which feels quite distinctive from other brooding Marvel mavericks. Cumberbatch\u2013mastering a rather effective American-accented sorcerer with skill\u2013has injected a degree of inventive nobility and refinement that uplifts this calculating comic-book fantasy.\r\n\r\nCumberbatch\u2019s egotistical Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon. His hands are truly miraculous tools of his medical trade and he takes pride in his abilities to treat the critical patients that have tremendous hope courtesy of his therapeutic capabilities. In a nutshell, Strange outshines his other surgical competitors because he is able to give to his patients on the operating table something other doctors cannot instantly muster up. However, cruel fate strikes its ugly head when Strange suffers the usage of his precious hands as a result of a horrific car wreck. The nerves in his hands are destroyed and the non-functioning of his limbs is an awful reminder that his surgical talents are something of the immediate past.\r\n\r\nAs Strange delves into self-pity and surfacing depression he cannot see just how supportive his fellow physician Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdam) is toward him. Clearly, Christine is in love with the alienating medical moper but Strange simply does not realize the extent of her affections because he is too busy sulking about his misfortune. The only factor that gets a promising rise out of Strange is his recent acknowledgement of the Tibetan community where there is a Kamar-Taj temple rumored to restore ailing body parts destined to make an individual \u201cwhole\u201d and \u201ccomplete\u201d once again. Naturally, Strange wants to bypass the tedious and lengthy therapy sessions for a chance to experience the miracle of his once-amazing operating digits now ravaged by severe nerve damage.\r\n\r\nThe main source behind the Kamar-Taj temple\u2019s heralded existence is The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton). She is instrumental in teaching the fundamentals of a selected Eastern mysticism that teaches the special concentration of healing the wounded and wasting human body when scientific medical practices fail to do so. Soon, Strange\u2019s affiliation with The Ancient One and her mystical minions has more than a transfixing effect on gaining control of his ailing hands as he gains indescribable powers through the inner strength of mind and soul. Now, Dr. Strange can generate his own alternating state of philosophical wizardry that dictates shaping time and space dimensions. Strange\u2019s out-of-body experiences supersede all his previous physical impairments as a force to be reckoned with at large. Whether observing Strange\u2019s Cloak of Levitation methods or witnessing his supernatural prowess on the mean streets against wickedness Doctor Strange spins a wild and weird web of action-packed surrealism that is a welcomed addition to Marvel Comics\u2019 showcasing of super-heroic protective cads feisty in flaws and frivolity.\r\n\r\nCumberbatch is mesmerizing as the self-absorbed genius Strange who perhaps is the best complex Marvel-related protagonist since Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s flippant Tony Stark/Iron Man. The combination of heightened arrogance and high-brow self-doubt and vulnerability tactically works as Cumberbatch sells this portrayal solidly. Although Swinton\u2019s The Ancient One is an intriguing enigma in her own right one must question why the absence of an Asian actor not considered for this particular role may have some scratching their heads in indignation? McAdam\u2019s love interest Christine amounts to only being an afterthought not just in the eyes of her object of affection Strange but to the audience as well.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the other supporting players contribute marvelously to the festivities. Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor (Cumberbatch\u2019s co-star from the Academy Award-winning \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) plays fellow sorcerer Mordo while Benedict Wong assumes the duty as another one of The Ancient One\u2019s followers who guards the school\u2019s sacred scriptures. Mads Mikkelsen is devilishly received as Kaecilius, the former disciple of The Ancient One gone rogue whose agenda in releasing an ominous demon Dormammu to the world will test the will of Doc Strange\u2019s newfound mystical techniques and tactics.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that **Doctor Strange** is an impeccably surging superhero fable laced with stunning aesthetics and a richly robust score by Michael Giachinno. The high caliber of talent associated with this spry comic book actioner definitely ensures another superhero film franchise-in-the-making as Cumberbatch\u2019s introspective doc administers his **Strange** dosage of Marvel movie-making medicine for the ages.\r\n\r\n**Doctor Strange** (2016)\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 10 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Rachel McAdam, Benedict Wong, Benjamin Bratt\r\n\r\nDirected by: Scott Derrickson\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction & Fantasy/Action & Adventures/Comic Book Fable\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** 1/2 (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016", "Though the core events may not be anything new for the MCU, particularly in so far as its origin stories go (Stephen Strange's A-to-B is virtually identical to Tony Stark's in the first _Iron Man_ film) the psychedelic filter through which we experience these events is entirely fresh!\r\n\r\nNot all of the humour lands, and in fact sometimes actually detracts from the story. While the effects are very impressive from a conceptual angle, the graphical end-products do sometimes fall short. Benedict Cumberbatch is a fantastic actor, and does a fine job as Doctor Strange, virtually the whole cast are proven actors, but none are really given the chance to flex those acting muscles to any sort of a newly impressive degree.\r\n\r\nThose minor nitpicks aside, _Doctor Strange_ is another very successful entry to the MCU, just further proving that Marvel really know what they're doing in this latest form the film industry has taken.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I strongly recommend you make the time._", "I will begin this by saying I was hyped about this film since it was announced because I was always attracted to magic and the supernatural and Doctor Strange is one of my favorite Marvel superheroes.\r\n PLOT:A simple enough story,a brilliant surgeon's journey from the peak of his career to a ruined man,incapacitated due to an accident.Losing all his money in an attempt to heal his hands,he finds out about a mysterious healer in a place called Kamar-Taj.With his last dollars, he gets a one-way ticket to Nepal to find this place and is introduced like so into a whole new world.He has an affinity for what he discovers to be called \"The Mystic Arts\".He learns and develops quickly but is thrown into a fight with the one who would become his first nemesis, Kaelcilius,too soon.He is almost killed but with the help of his ex-fianc\u00e9e,Dr. Christine Palmer(who operates on him) he is saved and returns to the Sanctum Sanctorum.He tries to stop Kaelcilius but needs to be rescued again by his teacher,who is killed and leaves him with a valuable lesson.To finally defeated the Zealots he bargains with their boss,catching him into a time loop for all eternity if he does not call his servants off and sets everything right.In the end his ex-friend and mentor,Mordo goes on a quest of finding himself and ends up becoming a sorcerer murderer. \r\nCharacters: \r\n1)Dr.Stephen Strange:Benedict portrays him amazingly and is always on point with the character.I liked his journey and how he changed and grew to see that he is just a tiny bit of an infinite multiverse.He was pretty good using magic and I hope he will develop quicker to the Sorcerer Supreme. \r\n2)The Ancient One:My favorite character in the movie.She is a wise teacher,has the best quotes,best battle scenes,best entrances and an amazing battle costume.I loved how even she was aware that for higher goals she needed to cross the line and do things she teaches against and also isn't proud of. \r\n3)Kaelcilius:A tragedy of love brought him to Kamar-Taj where he ascended to the rank of master.Tired of following The Ancient One and still haunted by the death of his loved he seeks to stop time,to give his new teacher,Dormammu our world.Mads was amazing in the role,his whole ideology of time as the enemy of humans and them longing for eternity is interesting and really on point.He briefly achieved his goal,a shame he became a mindless one. \r\n4)Karl Mordo:Another prominent student,who doesn't ask questions,doesn't contradict and is pretty adamant about trust and has lots of issues with bending the rules.He was very disappointing and boring and his only interesting feat was that he became a villain. \r\n5)Wong:Decent but underused character,he will surely be seen a lot in the later movies as Strange's right hand. \r\nMagic:We are introduced to magic as an energy harnessed from various dimensions to create things of need,to conjure spells.An interesting take on such a vague but intriguing subject. \r\nPost-Credit Scenes:\r\n 1)Thor scene:takes place in 2017 with Thor asking our Doctor(has gloves,seems more powerful,informed) for help to find his father,trapped on Earth.He accepts with the condition that they would leave our realm as soon as they are reunited. \r\n2)Mordo scene:He went on a quest of getting rid of all the sorcerers of Earth. \r\nOverall:A very decent movie with amazing special effects and super acting.A must see.", "**When a science person was the chosen one in the spiritual world!**\r\n\r\nYou would have not expected it from this director if you had seen his previous films. This was based on the Marvel comics that I haven't touched. So basically I had high expectation to witness another side of Marvel universe with another set of (super)heroes. And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique.\r\n\r\nJust like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed.\r\n\r\nVisually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins. The success story of Marvel continues. Not everybody reads comic books, but film goers are the majority. So adaptations like this are people like me. Let them keep coming, I love this format better. This film is not just for the youngsters, but old, families, as well as kids can enjoy, so I hope you won't miss it.\r\n\r\n_8/10_", "It is actually quite some time since I watched Doctor Strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since I appear to have forgotten to review it. So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.\r\n\r\nI have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.\r\n\r\nDoctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than \u201ca bit\u201d. He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.\r\n\r\nThe time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk\u2019s bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange\u2019s continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.\r\n\r\nSlowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.\r\n\r\nAs the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.\r\n\r\nI am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.\r\n\r\nThere were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.\r\n\r\nI rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.\r\n\r\nSo, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking.", "I thought marvel was going to far with all the releases.I was right about this one,Dr Strange was like Inception on DMT.Far to much CGI!.And for the story it started off in the right direction then it just ended up going STRANGE.All in all worth a look.But nothing special.", "It was only a matter of time before magic and time travel found their way into the MCU, but Doctor Strange is a really well put together origin story on a character that could have been a mess to adapt as a film. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Mads Mikkelsen, along with the Benedicts give the film lots of charisma, but the real star here is the style that Scott Derrickson and his crew were able to create. This is such a cool looking movie, both beautiful to look at and impressively technical.\r\n\r\nLike most Marvel movies, Doctor Strange has a mediocre generic villain, but the characters combined with the visuals still make for a uniquely entertaining experience."], "283995": ["I didn\u2019t enjoy this as much as the first one. Too long \u2014 could have been about 30 minutes shorter. I don\u2019t mind long movies, but they shouldn\u2019t feel long. There\u2019s some good humour throughout the movie and the characters are enjoyable, particularly Rocket who is my favourite! Story is pretty thin. Some good action sequences, of course. Overall, an average movie. Has lost some of the freshness of the original.", "_Logan_, 2017's first Marvel offering, was a movie I loved because of just how little it relied on its comic book origins, completely forgoing the superhero tropes and going in its own unique and totally enthralling direction.\r\n\r\n_Guardians 2_ however, is a movie I loved because of just how intensely it embraced its comic book origins. The Kirby-isms shine through brilliantly and every couple of minutes I found myself grinning like an idiot at some new reference or stylistic choice.\r\n\r\n_Logan_ might be the super hero movie for people who don't like super hero movies. _Guardians 2_ is the super hero movie for people who have steeped themselves deeply in the lore of super heroes. But I absolutely adore them both for the same reason: How they made me **feel**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - An all round good movie with a little something extra._", "The David Hasselhoff of all reviews, obviously.\r\n\r\nDo you have any tape?\r\n\r\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, directed by James Gunn, is an action-packed Marvel comedy. The guardians unravel the mysteries of Star-lord aka Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) broken history while avoiding constant danger. Oh. And did I mention the soundtrack? Muy bueno! 8)\r\n\r\nUnlike most sequels, Vol. 2 might actually be better than Vol. 1.\r\n\r\nThe entire cast is more likable than the first film. Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) has more comedic lines like, \"When you're ugly and someone loves you, it means they love you for who you are.\"\r\n\r\nRocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) still maintains a sentimental but adorably tough persona. And Baby Groot is cute as ever whenever he says,\"I am groot.\" In his baby-voice.\r\n\r\nOne of the more noticeable differences is the relationship between Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Star-lord. It's not as intimate. We were all hoping for a sci-fi sex scene. We don't get it!\r\n\r\nThe fight scenes are nothing less than spectacular. There's a scene with Yondu (Michael Rooker) where he's using a whistle-controlled weapon to kill an entire space crew of villains ALL IN SLOW-MOTION!\r\n\r\nJust go watch the film. It's worth it for the cgi-artwork alone.", "\u201cGuardian\u2019s are back to save the galaxy once again\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt in this movie the true star was baby Groot the part that how he understands and gives out his understandings in his own style which makes us laugh out loud. Got to see a funny side in Drax the before edition he was always angry this one he always laughs I like the part he keeps saying positive things and suddenly ends it with a negative touch. Now to talk about gamora and quill love is in the air but she keeps denying it.

That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well.

Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.\r\n\r\nIt's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.\r\n\r\nJames Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies.

I can't stand how Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 thinks family dynamic is just two people bickering about how much daddy didn't love them as kids. It makes no sense to me why James Gunn or Marvel think that every scene needs to have multiple jokes thrown in no matter what the tone of the scene is supposed to be. Drax's overused laugh was annoying. Yes, I get it, Baby Groot is dumb. Hahaha.... Oh, now you're ugly shaming a character and playing it for jokes?\r\n\r\nOne note characters, a stupid plot of nothing interesting happening, and of course Starlord's father, a celestial, is nothing more than an evil being setting out to destroy the universe. Does Marvel not realize that villains can have other kinds of motivation?\r\n\r\nThe only two good things about this movie are the soundtrack and the fact that the events have no effect on the overarching MCU plot.

But _Homecoming_ is my favourite of the bunch. 2017 has been a great year for  the Superhero genre, and _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ does nothing to buck that trend. It's got everything a Spider-Man movie should have: Heart, humour, action, spectacle, a grounded school life, coming-of-age themes, and all this while firmly rooting itself in the Marvel Cinematic Universe -- without relying on the framework of the past to hold it up. _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ is spectacular, and it stands up both on its own, and as a part of the larger universe.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it.

It is an excellent action/adventure movie for kids. Unfortunately I am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.\r\n\r\nThe movie is childish. There is no other way to describe it. My memory of spider man is a quite serious young man with a sharp and witty tongue. Not the fumbling and childish Spider Man in this movie.

The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.\r\n\r\nThis story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.\r\n\r\nTom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity.

Michael Keaton is excellent as Vulture, one of the more interesting villains in the MCU.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Tony Stark and Peter Parker is good but should have been better.

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before.

Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.\r\n\r\nI actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less\u2026well\u2026stupid!\r\n\r\nPersonally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.", "I was really surprised how much I liked this movie.  There was so much going on; immigration concerns; the fight between saving the world and protecting your own country(sound familiar); the fear of an African country\u2019s resources being pillaged; how best to handle the problems black people face worldwide; and many great authentic feeling cultural nods.  All this while not being heavy or preachy.  You can definitely eat popcorn to this.  The villain; Killmonger, is great.  Not great in that he is scary, though he is, but because he is more complex than some shadowy figure you should just trust is a bad guy because of visual effects or dramatic music.  \r\n\r\nThis movie isn\u2019t just explosions and one-liners in an exotic location.  This is a great movie in general.  It\u2019s always interesting.  There are great relationships between all the characters.  Finally; Wakanda is really a place.  It feels alive and lived in; not just impressive buildings used as a backdrop.  They did a wonderful job of worldbuilding; from the rituals, to the clothing, fancy tech, and scenery.  This movie is definitely worth a watch. \r\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606-1/2\r\n\r\nI also have to add that; you get to actually see Andy Serkis!  When I saw his name I thought we was going to be some kind of CGI monster.  I\u2019m just happy to see him get actual screen time.", "The Black Panther is a fun romp, but it definitely has some issues. First, the good.\r\n\r\nThe action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. \r\n\r\nWhile the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. \r\n\r\nIn fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.\r\n\r\nThe story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. \r\n\r\nThis is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. \r\n\r\nIn addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. \r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda.", "The character of T'Challa made his debut in Captain America 3: Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn Black Panther, T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda after the death of his father who has been hiding a secret about his brother who lived in the USA.

Unfortunately, T\u2019Challa\u2019s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d (Michael B. Jordan).\r\n\r\nWith its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called \u201cracist\u201d by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie\u2019s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn\u2019t all that involving. It\u2019s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even \u201cAnt-Man\u201d (2015).\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there\u2019s some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a \u201ccolonizer,\u201d which isn\u2019t even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic\u2019s story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the \"Panther's Rage\" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. \r\n\r\nAnd it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T\u2019Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It\u2019s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn\u2019t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguaz\u00fa Waterfalls, Argentina.

And apart from Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smeagol (Andy Serkis), everybody\u2019s black. And that\u2019s the way it should be.\r\nThe entire cast delivers. Boseman is excellent as king T\u2019Challa who struggles with his new role. It doesn\u2019t get any easierr when Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) shows up. Killmonger is a mean SOB yet you care for him (some good writing right there). He\u2019s a worthy adversary and one of the better Marvel villains. Jordan portrays him perfectly. Director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are a match made in heaven. This is their third collaboration after \u2018Fruitvale Station\u2019 and \u2018Creed\u2019 and again they\u2019re successful. The movie itself gets better as Jordan\u2019s role gets bigger.\r\n\r\nThe female characters and actors are equally impressive.

The movie doesn\u2019t need it.\r\n\r\nThough it\u2019s set in (fictional) Africa there wasn\u2019t any filming done in Africa. Nonetheless the movie looks right.

Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked.

The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia.

I would not expect a deep and thought provoking story from a super hero movie nor would I want it. It served as a decent enough vehicle for moving things forward.\r\n\r\nMost of the actors did a good enough job of the role they were given which in some cases was pretty much mission impossible given some of the overly silly characters in the movie. In particular I got tired of Luis almost before the first scenes he was in had finished. He was just so silly that you started to wonder what age the target audience was. Jimmy Woo was not far behind.\r\n\r\nI think this leads to my main gripe with the movie. I expected a super hero movie but what I got was a fairly lame comedy with super heroes in it. It was just too much comic elements in it for me. I could probably have liked it if the jokes were somewhat intelligent but, for me, they were not. They alternated between overly silly and stupid characters, slap-stick and simple fall-on-your ass jokes.\r\n\r\nWhat about the bad guy? Well, first off, there was not really a distinct bad guy but a hole bunch of them. Unfortunately none of them had any real bad guy charisma. I assume that Sonny was supposed to be the main bad guy and he certainly had enough evil lunatic air about him to fit that but again\u2026too silly. Then we have the lame Jimmy Woo who was just annoying. The Ghost was probably the best one but then she was not really a bad guy was she?\r\n\r\nI did like most of the action and the special effects though. The playing around with shrinking and returning to normal size, or greater, was both cool and funny. This shrinking business is of course a difficult theme to work with from a science and logic point of view. For instance, if you shrink a car to the size of a toy car it still weighs like a full size one and you cannot just pick it up. And what about the lab popping up and down all the time? Why weren\u2019t everything shaken to bits inside when they started to run around with it? And don\u2019t get me started about electricity and plumbing. But then, in this kind of movie I would say just just have to turn off that part of your brain. It made for some cool scenes after all.\r\n\r\nI also did like that the story was more of a down to Earth story. No overall galactic plot, no snapping of fingers to make\u2026well you know what. Okay, there was the post credit scenes which was a bit of an annoying tie in. Perhaps best of all though, I could not really feel much SJW or other form of politically correct preaching being showed down my throat.

I'm not part of any hate group or factions that hate those hate groups. I just want to watch a good superhero origin film, that introduces me to a new character that I'm supposed to care about and root for. Read my review, sure, but make up your own mind. Go see the movie and be honest. Since that's out of the way, let's keep going ...\r\n\r\nIt was always going to be a huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like Carol Danvers into the end of Phase Three. Not only she comes from nowhere (as far as I remember, she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before Infinity War), but it's the last movie before the climactic, era-ending Avengers: Endgame. She is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against Thanos, the bad guy who I dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment. So, while I was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action, I was also hoping for more than just a simple origin film like it came from Phase One.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's exactly what I got. Everything is fine. Just okay. There's no exceptional fight scene, but most of it is decent. There's no visual wonder, but it doesn't look bad. The characters' potential feels wasted, but they work for the plot. Everything is frustratingly balanced, which is something I would praise in a bunch of other movies, but this isn't 2008 anymore. Marvel isn't starting its cinematic universe, it is almost finishing a whole arc involving more than 20 installments! I'm going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about: Goose ... Sorry, Captain Marvel! Jokes aside, this is one of the issues I was worried about going into the film theater. I escaped 99% of the marketing for this movie as I do with every other flick. I didn't watch a single clip/trailer, I know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and I kept my expectations realistic having in mind what I truly know about the film and only the film itself. The one thing I was not able to hide from were the headlines giving tremendous praise to ... a cat.\r\n\r\nNow, follow me on this: I'm going to watch a superhero origin movie. A whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen. I'm excited to know more about her, where does she come from, what her powers are and so much more. Some headlines show up on my social media feed, and I find that a CAT \"steals the show,\" \"deserves a spin-off,\" and I don't even know what more. Granted, the cat is indeed funny. It provides some chuckles here and there. That's it. I love cats, but I honestly can't figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things. Maybe it's because the rest of the film isn't that entertaining ... or perhaps just because people really, really love cats. Like the movie itself, I think it's a mixture of both options.\r\n\r\nBack to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about: Brie Larson. Marvel rarely misses its casting choices, and being Larson an Academy-Award winner, her talent is undeniable. She has everything she needs to consistently deliver a strong performance, so I'm surprised that she couldn't stand out from the film's overall blandness. I repeat, the movie isn't bad, at all. However, I was expecting an actress of Brie Larson's caliber to elevate, at least, her own character, but she's like everyone else: just good enough. I don't know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions, but the potential is there, and I'm sure the Russo brothers will give her a much more thrilling arc in Endgame.\r\n\r\nThe two best attributes of the entire film are, without a single doubt, the buddy-cop relationship that Carol and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) develop, and the groundbreaking de-aging CGI. Story-wise, the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear. Carol's past is often approached with quick flashes and a lot of cheap exposition, so it's a breath of fresh air to have SLJ and Larson play off of each other. Nevertheless, the de-aging technology used is absolutely astounding. My fellow readers, welcome to the future of filmmaking, where any actor/actress can portray a younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing. I completely forgot SLJ is 70-years-old! The best visual effects/CGI are the ones you don't even know they're there and Captain Marvel succeeds in delivering mind-blowing, realistic, younger versions of well-known actors.\r\n\r\nCharacter-wise, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck should have done way better. So much wasted potential in such a crucial moment in the MCU. Carol Danvers has a great backstory, but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact. Still, as Captain Marvel, she is indeed a badass woman! There are some cool action sequences, especially in the beginning, but as the movie slowly progresses on its story, the fight scenes got more sloppy, choppy and way too dark. Jude Law (Yon-Rogg) is amazing as he always is, and Ben Mendelsohn is brilliant as Talos. Both characters have interesting subplots that come together well, which is not something that can be said for the rest of the Marvel \"villains.\"\r\n\r\nTechnically ... You guessed it, it's okay! Taking away the jaw-dropping de-aging CGI, the visuals seem to lack some sort of style. Looking back at Black Panther, Captain America or Guardians of the Galaxy, each movie has a visual aesthetic that belongs to their own stories. Captain Marvel doesn't really feel like it has its own style. I truly feel that with other directors, this film could have been way better. Boden and Fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers, but maybe they were not ready to lead such a massive blockbuster. That said, the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movie's period. There are a couple of moments where the VFX regarding Carol Danvers's powers are spectacular, but everything ultimately feels like this is a Phase One film, instead of the 21st MCU installment.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Captain Marvel achieves the minimum requirements: introduce the fans to a new superhero, who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of Thanos. Carol Danvers is a fascinating character with an emotional backstory, but the screenplay isn't structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible. Brie Larson delivers a strong performance, pushing aside her haters, even if I feel that under other directors, she would have reached her character's full potential. Her scenes with Samuel L .Jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie, as well as the groundbreaking de-aging CGI, which is absolutely mind-blowing. The action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography (this is MCU's Phase Three and 2019, so I want to be able to actually see what's happening), but the most prominent \"issue\" is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin film's formula. This isn't exactly a flaw or a problem, it's just that I was expecting more. A lot more.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there's not a memorable fight scene, an emotionally overwhelming moment or even a genuinely bone-chilling, epic scene. It doesn't leave you salivating for Avengers: Endgame, but it also doesn't leave you less excited. Everything is just ... fine. And there's nothing wrong with that. But there's also nothing extraordinary.\r\n\r\nRating: B-", "Captain Marvel is a hot mess narratively and never really knows what kind of movie it wants to be. Brie Larson is constantly fighting direction and poor writing and losing the battle in the end. The last thing the MCU needs right now is a Mary Sue with no life. The one thing this movie misses more than anything else though is heart. Without a reason or purpose for existing one is left asking\u2026other than explaining pointless MCU plot points and creating a plethora of fresh plot holes\u2026why was this movie made and who was it made for? Kudos must be given to the make-up artists and a lot of the tech guys behind the scenes. C-", "I wasn't going to see this movie at all based on the stupid comments made by Brie Larson but I tagged along with some friends anyway. Let me just say it was a massive mistake. I underestimated how difficult it would be to stand looking at the lead actress misogynistic and talentless face for two hours. On top of the train wreck that was her 'performance' the whole story just felt flat and bland, I don't want to spoil the plot for those who have already bought tickets and are going to see it anyway, but let's just say that it was almost as underwhelming in story as it was in acting. DO NOT RECOMMEND!\r\n\r\n1/10", "Captain Marvel bored the living hell out of me. I'm tired of these special effects laden \"event films\" where every scene has to be flashy lights and fighting and explosions where nothing of real value is at stake. Not one character in this film has a personality or character arc. It's one big extended buildup to showcase how badly Captain Marvel is going to kick Thanos' ass. I like the character but I did not like what this movie does with her character. I was also shocked at how bad Brie Larson's performance was; she's an incredible actress but I feel Jennifer Lawrence put more effort into her Mystique than Larson did with Carol Danvers.\r\n\r\nAlso if your idea of female empowerment is a nasty leather jacket biker guy whistling at a girl saying \"give me a kiss\" and then the girl just goes and steals his bike, you have no clue what real female empowerment is.", "okay i wanted to see this despite the 'contravercy sexist pig like men have turned this into'so i went to my local theater picked a showtime and picked out some snacks the movie was decent not good not bad just the right amount of each to make it watchable for folks the action had a nice pace and the humor was just right and i think captain marvel herself is a beautiful badass and i adored the cat he was so cute and fluffy i say go see it dont over expect but go see it", "I never watched a movie 2 time but captain marvel is one and only movie that i watched 2 time in my life.Amazing movie.", "It has good visuals, good action, and some decent humour. This movie does what it needs to do by introducing Captain Marvel, although I was hoping Marvel would do something different and unique from their other origin story.", "Look, as an actor, it is your duty to make sure that you promote your brand to the best of your ability, it's JUST as important as the work that you do shooting the film. I don't care about the political side of the events that transpired before the release of this movie, but I hope that Hollywood learns the lesson taught by Brie Larson.", "*  I liked the CGI special effects and a few of the plot twists they threw in keep it from being too predictable. Cons: Completely neglecting the source material, appropriating the existing character and twisting them to send a message. Capt Marvell was a male super hero and they should have ran with Ms Marvel or made a new super-hero character for this film. Breaking canon - Facts established in previous MCU films were contradicted in this film, so now I don't know which film's telling of history to believe. Handling of Nick Fury's character was poorly done. I won't see him as the gritty, battle-hardened vet that he was in previous films.\r\nAdvice - Skip this film. It causes confusion by disrupting everything that came before it. It's like a reboot of the marvel universe ... or a parallel dimension. Save your money for another movie.\r\n* Summary: Decent, but Breaks the MCU", "Not too bad if you didn't set high expectation.\r\nOverall is ok.\r\nAction is nice.", "It was alright. Some entertaining scenes and the de-aging they did on Samuel L. Jackson was fantastic. Still not sure about Brie Larson in the lead but at least showed far more personality than her blank stares in Endgame. The visual effects also was fairly good, especially on Earth (vs. on Hala or w/e it was called). Worth a rental."], "299534": ["The epic Marvel Saga that started over ten years ago has been building up to the inevitable clash with the powerful tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin).  Last year\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. \r\n\r\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5", "Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see _Endgame_ again.\r\n\r\nPutting it out there right from the get-go, _Avengers: Endgame_ is my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\r\n\r\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _Endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of _Infinity War_ but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\r\n\r\nTo me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it._", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nDon't worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it's such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don't think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It's epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It's pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don't expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that's going to make you pretty much either \"love\" or \"like\" this movie. I absolutely love it! \r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can't deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don't have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\r\n\r\nSome people didn't really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn't work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. \r\n\r\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won't know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who've lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\r\n\r\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it's still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act's tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn't expect such an \u201ceasygoing\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can't wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It's just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this review, and I'm getting chills all over my body. \r\n\r\nI can't really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson's, Evans', and Robert Downey Jr's (Tony Stark / Iron Man). \u201cNew\u201d characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don't judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors' minds in the first place!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't know what to do now. The only thing I'm sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn't fall asleep properly because I couldn't stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It's everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It's that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can't even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we'll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\r\n\r\nPS: it's not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn't exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn't everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don\u2019t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame \u2026 And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nRating: A+", "okay so if your like me you questioned this movie due to the fact that i personally thought nothing could beat infinity war well after seeing it i can honestly say we have a new champion this was absolutley excelent so hilarious action packed the 3 hrs passes extremily fast my only thing is the use of god.... bothered me and i suggest if your offended by that wait till dvd so you can mute the parts also a reminder to parents 'no matter how bad you want to see the movie dont do like people in my theater did and bring your 3 year old 'but besides that awesome movie", "We waited till day 5 of release in theaters. There was a slow start to the movie so i don't recommend taking little ones under the age of 10. After all the anticipation and hype,Avengers Endgame did not disappoint. Waa a perfect \"ending' to the series. Very well done", "These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it\u2019s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.\r\n\r\nI have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.\r\n\r\nIt was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending \u2026 well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled about the \u201cnew\u201d Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill\u2019s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.\r\n\r\nI was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos\u2019 crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.\r\n\r\nThere were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos\u2019 ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.\r\n\r\nThere were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.", "Awesome!", "***How can they possibly save half of all living beings in the Universe?***\r\n\r\nHow are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in \"Infinity War\" weren\u2019t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I\u2019ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \"Back to the Future II\" (1989).\r\n\r\n\u201cEndgame\u201d (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.\r\n\r\nEverything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff\u2019s edge, and much more. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can\u2019t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie\u2019s overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-", "The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren\u2019t enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers.

And while this film finally gives us a Peter/MJ love story, it\u2019s all too familiar territory - not because of the characters involved but because we saw Peter pursue a crush in \u2018Homecoming\u2019.

So, if you still didn\u2019t watch the latter or heard what happens in it (by some inexplicable reason), this is a SPOILER WARNING for the events of that era-ending film. Moving on to the web-slinger, this sequel is everything it should be and a bit more. It beautifully encapsulates how everyone\u2019s feeling about the central death of Endgame, especially Peter Parker. I wished Jon Watts would put a lot of focus into Spider-Man\u2019s grief and I hoped that a big part of the plot would be him just having to deal with the fact that his mentor/father figure is gone. He can\u2019t continue to just be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He needs to grow up and become what everyone expects of him: to be the best of them all.\r\n\r\nWatts does all of it. There are so many emotionally powerful dialogues featuring Nick Fury or Happy (Jon Favreau) or even just moments with Tom Holland just standing alone and having to breathe through the pain of losing someone you love. The pressure that everyone is putting on his shoulders is immense, maybe too much for a simple teenager, but he\u2019s everything but simple. I love every single bit of story dedicated to Peter and Tony Stark\u2019s (Robert Downey Jr.) relationship. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wrote a wonderful screenplay, and Jon Watts executed it seamlessly. However, the reason why all of this works is due to Tom Holland\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nHe said in an interview he would play Spider-Man until he can and until producers let him. I hope he stays around for years without end. He\u2019s not only my favorite on-screen Spider-Man but my favorite on-screen Peter Parker as well. I love how he spends most of the movie holding on to his feelings, and in the last act, he just lashes out because he can\u2019t take it anymore. He left my eyes close to tearing up in probably the best dialogue of the film with Happy. As a superhero, he perfectly embodies what Spidey is all about, and Holland has the plus of doing most of his action stunts. As a teenager, he\u2019s incredibly funny, innocent, and he still doesn\u2019t know how to deal with falling in love or having a crush, which leads me to the second of the three main storylines of this movie: his relationship with MJ. \r\n\r\nZendaya did get some criticism from fans who, well, don\u2019t like the fact that MJ is not the same one as in Sam Raimi\u2019s original trilogy (physically and psychologically). Same for Holland and the fact that this Spider-Man has a lot more \u201cgadgets\u201d than Tobey Maguire\u2019s. For those people, I only have one advice: understand that this is a distinct universe with different takes on characters we know and with other stories to tell which are, in fact, the closest we had to the comics so far. The sooner you accept this, the easier will be for you to enjoy these films. Having that in mind, MJ didn\u2019t have much to do in Homecoming. Actually, she was even played as a post-credits twist so that the sequel could focus more on her \u2026 and it did.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship gradually evolves throughout the movie smoothly and realistically. They\u2019re teenagers! Having their first crush, trying to come up with a good time and place to tell the other they like them, being nervous when they\u2019re together and being anxious when they\u2019re separated \u2026 Watts handled this subplot very well. It didn\u2019t feel forced (rom-coms should take some tips), Zendaya and Holland\u2019s chemistry is palpable, and I love this new MJ. Most of the superhero\u2019s lovers are the cliche damsel in distress, always needing saving and making dumb decisions. Zendaya\u2019s MJ not only can handle herself, but she has an unique personality that makes her stand out.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third and last storyline relies on Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). I can\u2019t really get in-depth about this character because he has a massive impact on the narrative, but I can guarantee that Gyllenhaal makes this character work. I like how they approached Mysterio, but if it wasn\u2019t for the outstanding actor that Gyllenhaal is, Far From Home would have suffered a bit. The relationship between him and Spider-Man is well-developed, but the character of Mysterio lacked better treatment. There\u2019s an exposition dump midway through the runtime that\u2019s just horrible. Really, really bad. However, the film moves on and gets better until it reaches the last 45 minutes, which are unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI will always prefer a slow start and a fantastic finish than the other way around. Far From Home struggles with the first two acts\u2019 pacing, but the last one compensates that with some of the best action a Spider-Man movie ever had! There are so many sequences where our superheroes are just going at it, flying and swinging across buildings, bridges, and rivers like we\u2019ve seen before, only better. The CGI looked like it could be excessive in the trailers, but instead, it\u2019s some of the best Marvel has shown us. Nevertheless, the jaw-dropping scenes are some that involve illusions, very much like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) had in his origin flick. Spider-Man has two memorable sequences (the VFX here are mind-blowing), one of which incorporates a certain superpower not seen in the MCU so far (officially, at least). The kid in me was smiling with pure joy, let\u2019s write that.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s on par with Homecoming. One is better than the other in various areas, but they\u2019re extremely different, so comparing them might be unfair. The first had the goal of introducing a \u201cnew\u201d character to the MCU, so the focus relied solely on Peter Parker having to deal with his powers and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This sequel is set so far away from the origin story and so much happened between these two that if people chose to watch them back-to-back, they wouldn\u2019t understand much of what\u2019s going on. Nevertheless, Far From Home still has its own issues.\r\n\r\nLike I wrote above, the first two acts struggle with its pacing. While it\u2019s refreshing to watch Spider-Man in other cities besides New York, the transitions between them are ridiculously fast, especially one that takes Peter Parker to another country in such an illogical way. The film tries to play off these less rational moments with comedy bits quite often and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work, affecting both the tone and pacing. I liked Ned in Homecoming, and I also enjoyed his presence here, but this time he almost felt like just a comic relief guy instead of that essential \u201csidekick\u201d to Spider-Man. Michael Giacchino\u2019s score is good, but for some reason, I couldn\u2019t really connect with it, which I think it\u2019s the first time I don\u2019t exactly love Giacchino\u2019s themes. Finally, the comedy skits could be better, they don\u2019t land that many times and the one supposedly funny scene I remember is the absolute worst.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I still had a blast! I think I prefer Far From Home to Homecoming since the latter deals with a much more complex and emotionally compelling story than the origin flick. The action is some of the MCU\u2019s best and definitely as great as Spider-Man\u2019s action ever was, featuring some mind-bending, astonishing sequences. The cast is brilliant, especially Tom Holland who cements his spot as the best on-screen web-slinger ever. Zendaya and Jon Favreau are also amazing, but I have to praise Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance because he\u2019s just awesome every single time. It\u2019s the movie the MCU needed after the tragic events of Endgame. It works because we feel what Peter Parker\u2019s feeling and we can deal with our grief with the help of Spider-Man\u2019s journey in this film. Aside from some minor problems with pacing, comedy, and exposition, the last act plus the two post-credits scenes, which have a tremendous impact on the movie and on what\u2019s to come on Phase Four, are more than enough for you to go see this film at the theater. Don\u2019t miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: B+", "Problems: I thought the Gyllenhaal character was corny, Spidey taking selfies too out of character for a selfless hero, and the Fury twist throughout the movie really unnecessary. \r\n\r\nWhat I liked: Tom Holland continues to be a charming actor.", "There's a some things in _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ that I personally didn't love. But I got **exactly** what I wanted from Mysterio, and that was so important to me. It's pretty amazing that the MCU is twenty three films deep, and they're still bringing out this sort of quality. I know this series is not for everyone. But until they start making movies I don't like, I'm gonna keep showing up.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._", "I just came home with the kids from the cinema where we had watched Spider-Man: Far From Home so I thought I would write a few lines while it was still fresh in my mind.\r\n\r\nI have to say that it was a decent enough movie. I didn\u2019t exactly regret having forked out the money to watch it in the cinema but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s far from a great movie and the end scene\u2026well it\u2019s a typical really crappy Hollywood ending where the writer cannot be bothered to spend time creating something intelligent so he just goes for the usual sensationalist cliffhanger bullshit.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming, this is a Spider-Man for kids, or at least younger people, movie which perhaps is part of why I am somewhat lukewarm towards it. This one did not feel as childish as the previous one but there is still a lot of teenage angst and rubbish in it. The plot is of course highly predictable as well.\r\n\r\nThe special effects on the other hand are quite good and essentially what makes the movie worth watching. At least to me. The end fight with hundreds of those drones flying around intermixed with Mysterio\u2019s illusions where quite cool. A bit over the top perhaps but cool nonetheless.", "I liked it okay, I guess. Tom Holland was good and shared good chemistry with Zendaya and some of the action was okay, but the so-called plot was rather weak and how it forced into the Iron Man movies fell flat, as did Gyllenhaal post-turn including an awkwardly written exposition scene. Definitely not as good as Homecoming and really reminded me why Marvel proper (mostly) is better at this than Sony-Marvel.", "Great film!", "Great family movie. Has enough comedy, action, and drama to keep you entertained. Love how the villain played on poor old Spideys naiveness. Underwhelming ending though."]}
